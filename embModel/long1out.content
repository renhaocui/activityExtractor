That's the end from #BeatTheBreach
From the audience #BeatTheBreach: industry takes #InfoSec seriously, but gov't doesn't show same urgency based on experience.
#BeatTheBreach: Like see regulation gov't not buy tech or software unless it has been pen tested for #backdoor. #InfoSec
#BeatTheBreach: @POTUS has policy on vulnerability disclosure. 46 recommendations of improvement. Mostly implemented. #InfoSec
#BeatTheBreach: Role of gov't is to help with information sharing. #InfoSec
#BeatTheBreach: Industry not waiting for gov't to help secure national #infrastructure. Ukraine #SCADA attack good demonstration. #InfoSec
#BeatTheBreach: Saw drop in corp attacks from China since agreement. But where did those hackers go? #GunsForHire? #InfoSec
#BeatTheBreach: Need to improve amount of #cybersecurity professionals and multilateral approach to hunt for #cybercriminals. #InfoSec
#BeatTheBreach: #POTUS has been too reactive. Next administration need to be more proactive. Incremental changes will not cut it.
#BeatTheBreach: Campaign of influence just like during #ColdWar. Use of #SocialMedia and #CyberAttacks to create distrust. #InfoSec
#BeatTheBreach: Russians are proving that #CyberAttacks could influence upcoming elections. #VoterRegistration a tempting target #InfoSec

Substitute Gyan rises to meet a Sumaila cross but heads it over
Like does erryone gotta be named Jesus??? #🇲🇽VS🇬🇭 #⚽️ #worldsMostWatchedSport!!!
Official attendance just above 37,600 according to stadium announcer. Dominated by Mexicans of course
Dwamena's hold up play and ability to bring others in really. Uses that body strength well
Frank Acheampong smashes an effort against the crossbar after he was beautifully set up by Dwamena. 2nd chance he has spinned
Mexico on the up in the second half. Have kept Ghana camped in their own half
Accam one of several players on too. Good form at club level needs to reflect

HT. Ghana 0 Mexico 1. Hernandez with the goal from the PK but Ghana has had chances. Warris, Dwamena, Acheampong, Agyepong all with chances
Sackey's ball retention has been poor
Lumor steps into the Mexico penalty area again but his left foot effort is blocked. He has been impressive this half
Ofori does well to keep out Hernandez's drive
First substitution. Munoz, still feeling the effect of a challenge from Boye is replaced by Corona
Good response by Ghana. Dwamena curls an effort in that Munoz pushes out
GOAL.. Hernandez tucks it beautifully to give Mexico the lead on 37 mins
PENALTY: Ref Toledo gives a penalty to Mexico for a challenge by Afful and Mensah
China's defending from corner kicks been rock solid. Boye and Mensah dealt with aerial situations well
John Boye is sapped into a challenge on the right side of the Ghana defence before committing a foul. Opportunity for Mexico from FK
The Mexican wave goes around as Munoz gets treatment following a challenge from John Boye
Harris's header is kept out by Munoz. A lot of the Ghana openings coming through him
Not your typical @miseleccionmx sellout. Still a great atmosphere here at NRG Stadium.   Tag us in your photos from… https://t.co/m6PvbP7QVn
